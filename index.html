                    <p class="lead mb-5"><strong>About Me</strong> <p></p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to my website. I am Hussein Tantawy, currently a student at the University of Birmingham studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. As a programmer, I am interested in the fields of Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Programming in general. It has always been my passion to solve complex technical problems, taking efficiency and performance into consideration. The quest to discover novel ways of optimizing algorithms, in order to improve my knowledge and skills, is something I am always on the lookout for.<br><br>Along with other hobbies, in my free time, I enjoy reading books, especially self-help books which help me develop as a person in many ways. I read these books with the intention of learning good habits with which I am able to add value to whatever I am working. Not only do I enjoy reading self-help books, but also, watch interviews and TED talks from successful figures in the technology arena which are captivating.Linus Torvalds, the Linux creator, gave a TED Talk that resonated with me. His example was simple yet elegant in this interview. Skilled programmers can identify ways to write code so that special cases become the norm. Ever since I saw it, I have tried to follow this example in all my practices.
                    My interest in Computer Science first began when I started watching the Crash Course about how to build websites. I was intrigued and fascinated to learn more, so I immediately started coding and taking notes. After completing the course, I also began researching the discipline and exploring the multiple fields of computer science. It was at this point that I decided to pursue a computer science degree.Despite having limited programming experience and being advised against choosing my degree due to my skills in the field, I decided to accept the challenge. This is because I thrived under these conditions. Along with completing my year two assignments, I began following online programming tutorials, coding practice problems, and consulting friends and lecturers for assistance. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge my university for providing me with the core concepts of computer science. After many late nights at the Computer Science labs and extra research, I now feel extremely confident with my array of skills and understanding of my subject. In my free time, I continue to enjoy solving coding challenges and building websites. Moreover, I plan to use my skills and expertise to succeed as a Software Engineer or a Software Developer, both as an intern, and when I graduate.</p>

                                <li><p><strong>Analytical and Problem Solving</strong></p>I was part of a team project in a hackathon event that required effective solutions to complex problems. For example, creating a system to allow new people to connect on the first day of the event. I have contributed to this project by designing the main website of the project itself using HTML.</li>

                                <li><p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> The ability to lead has been one of the skills I acquired through school. This is because I was constantly involved in social enterprise projects, where I had to lead and ensure that all participants were working collaboratively toward the project's success. <p></p></li>
                                <li><p></p><strong>Adaptability</strong><p>As part of a hackathon, I had the opportunity to work in a team with new people. This allowed me to be more flexible within a workforce and experience the feeling of working with a completely new team to produce the best possible results. By participating in this event, I was able to demonstrate my ability to embrace change, meet challenges with a positive attitude, and solve issues in a solution-oriented manner.</p></li>

When I presented with my group, I felt very confident. While working on the project, I demonstrated my collaborative skills and was able to effectively communicate with my group.</p></li>
                            <li><p></p><strong>Fast learner</strong><p>My free time during my second year at university was spent learning new programming languages in order to enhance my knowledge of the technology field. Since I was continuously practicing any language or concept I had just learned, it was extremely enjoyable for me. For instance, I had no prior experience with HTML and CSS, but I was surprised at how quickly I mastered the language during my second year. As a demonstration of my proficiency in the language, I developed my own websites.  </p></li>
